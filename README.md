## Vision

**Please note that Toxify is still undergoing heavy development!**

The development cycle of Toxify will be split into 3 major phases, each with their
own unique additions and modifications.

### Phase 1
- [x] Basic interface
- [x] Incoming messages
- [x] Outgoing messages
- [ ] Friend requests
- [x] User updates (status, message, name)
- [x] Change name and message
- [ ] Change status

### Phase 2
- [ ] Basic settings page
- [ ] Avatars
- [ ] Emojis
- [ ] Group chats
- [ ] One-on-one calls

### Phase 3
- [ ] Group calls
- [ ] File transfers
- [ ] Video chat
- [ ] Settings page
- [ ] Polish

In between each phase a session of refactoring will take place.

The end goal is a beautiful, themeable, cross-platform and feature-rich
client for Tox. Privacy and elegance in one.
